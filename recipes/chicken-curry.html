    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Try this easy chicken curry recipe for one of the simplest curry dishes you'll ever make! Just sauté chicken breasts with onion and curry powder, then serve over hot cooked rice with a side of mango chutney if desired.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient">
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup curry powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add onion and sauté until soft and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Slowly stir in curry powder until well blended.</li>
      <li>Add chicken; reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Uncover and cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until pan juices reduce to desired amount, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
